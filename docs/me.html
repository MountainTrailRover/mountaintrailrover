    <h2>HTML/CSS</h2>
    <p>The following topics related to HTML/CSS come up often in interviews and on the actual job when you’re working:</p>
    <p>
      <li>Semantic HTML: ANSWER</li>
      <li>CSS Box Model</li>
      <li>Benefits of CSS preprocessors</li>
      <li>CSS Media Queries to target different devices and write responsive CSS</li>

    JS
    Below are some topics you need to understand as a Full-Stack Developer:

    - Understand how to work with the DOM. Also know what JSON is and how to manipulate it.
    - Important language features such as functional composition, prototypal inheritance, closures, event delegation, scope, higher-order functions.
    - Asynchronous control flow, promises, and callbacks.
    - Learn how to properly structure your code and modularize parts of it, things like webpack, browserify, or build tools like gulp will definitely be helpful to know.
    - Know how to use at least one popular framework (many programs will focus heavily on teaching you a library or framework like React or AngularJS, but in reality it’s much more important to have a deep understanding of the JavaScript language and not focus so much on framework-specific features. Once you have a good understanding of JavaScript, picking up a framework that sits on top of it won’t be too hard anyway).
    - Although some may argue that you should be using this less or that it’s slowly dying, jQuery code still exists in most applications and a solid understanding of it will be helpful.
    Some knowledge on testing frameworks and why they’re important (some may even claim that this topic should be optional).
    Learn about some important new ES6 features (optional).

        React.JS
    -build three small apps with react native | Website | ToDo "Five" | ____
    -support these apps to show sustainability

    BackEnd
    - Node.js: This is a great option because Node.js is itself just a JavaScript environment which means you don’t need to learn a new language. This is a big reason why a lot of online programs and bootcamps choose to teach Node.js. The most popular framework you’d most likely learn to aid you in developing web applications is Express.
    - PHP is rarely taught in programs these days, but just like with Java, it is still very in-demand and it is a cornerstone of the web today.

    Databases

    - Understand the benefits of relational data, e.g. SQL
    - Learn about NoSQL databases, e.g. MongoDB
    - Understand which would be better in certain situations
    - Know how to connect a database with your chosen back-end language (e.g. Node.js + MongoDB)
    - Understand the benefits of in-memory data stores like Redis or memcached
    - Web storage to store sessions, cookies, and cached data in the browser
    - Scaling databases, ACID, and ORM (all optional)

    HTTP & REST
    HTTP is a stateless application protocol on the Internet — it’s what allows clients to communicate with servers (e.g. your JavaScript code can make an AJAX request to some back-end code you have running on a server which will happen via HTTP). Some important topics you should learn about are listed below:

    - What is REST and why is it important in regards to the HTTP protocol and web applications
    - Best practices for designing a RESTful API. POST/GET requests
    - Learning how to use Chrome DevTools can be extremely helpful
    - What are SSL Certificates
    - HTTP/2 & SPDY (optional)
    - WebSockets, Web Workers, and Service Workers (all optional)

    Web Application Architecture
    Once you think you have a grasp on HTML/CSS, JavaScript, back-end programming, databases, and HTTP/REST, then comes the tricky part. At this point if you want to create a somewhat complex web application, you’ll need to know how to structure your code, how to separate your files, where to host your large media files, how to structure the data in your database, where to perform certain computational tasks (client-side vs server-side), and much more.

    There are best practices that you can read about online on, but the best way to actually learn about application architecture is by working on a large application yourself that contains several moving parts — or even better, working on a team and together developing a somewhat large/complex application.

    This is why, for example, someone with 7+ years of experience may not necessarily know CSS or JavaScript better than someone with 2 years of experience, but over all of those years they’ve presumably worked with all sorts of different applications and websites and have learned how to architect and design applications (among learning other important things) to be most efficient and can see the “big picture” when it comes to development. Below are some things you can read that will help you learn how to architect your web applications efficiently:

    - Learn about common platforms as a service, e.g. Heroku and AWS. Heroku allows you to easily upload your code and have an application up and running with very little configuration or server maintenance and AWS offers dozens of products and services to help with storage, video processing, load balancing, and much more
    - Performance optimization for applications and modern browsers
    - Some opinions on what a web application architecture should include
    - Designing Web Applications by Microsoft
    - MVC
    - Most importantly though you should try to work on projects with people, look at codebases of popular projects on GitHub, and learn as much as you can from senior developers

    Git
    You should definitely learn the concept behind Git and play around with it yourself.

    - Here’s a reference list of some common git commands you’ll likely use
    - Here’s a tutorial on using Git and GitHub for beginners

    Algorithms & Data
    This topic is somewhat polarizing in the development world because there are developers who don’t think there should be such a heavy focus on computer science topics like tree traversal, sorting, algorithm analysis, matrix manipulation, etc. in web development. However, there are companies like Google that are notorious for asking these types of questions in their interviews. As someone said about the Front-End engineering interview at Google:

    That said, as Ryan McGrath mentions, our front-end (FE) engineers are expected to have a solid CS background, like all our engineers.
    While there are companies that practically require applicants to have a computer science degree or equivalent, there are plenty of companies that will hire people without this technical qualification if they can prove that they know how to develop applications and show an understanding of the whole domain. But part of being a competent developer and not writing inefficient code or using the wrong tools is an understanding of some basic algorithms and data structures and being able to analyze trade-offs. So here are some things you should definitely learn:

    - Improving your Algorithms & Data Structure Skills Article
    - Study hash tables and try to understand them on a deeper level. This data structure underlies objects in JavaScript (dictionaries in Python and hashes in Ruby)
    - Understand how trees and graphs can be beneficial as data structures
    - Understand the basics of Big-O analysis so you don’t do silly things like create a nested loop 3 levels down if you don’t need to
    - Know when to use an object vs an array and understand the trade-offs
    - Learn why caching is so important when working with a large amount of data. Also learn the pros and cons of in-memory vs disk storage
    - Learn the difference between queues and stacks.
